- if margin: auto not working  --> check height/width of this element. May be, it's width 100%

- auto is not value for padding property

- cssSelector:hover{} --- vs --- cssSelector :hover{}
   (1)                        (2)
if there are more than 2 child of(cssSelector), background-color will affect on all cssSelector, 
on the other hand, (2) affect on them independently. 

- From now, in HTML/CSS code, everything is "" by default. And in JS code, I use '' by default

- innerHTML: return HTML codes (insite current element), includes element nodes and text nodes
- outerHTML = tagName + innerHTML
- textContent: return a string that contains all content of text node (insite current element)
- value: return content of input tag
--->  Apply when set content for element (abc.textContent = ,...): innerHTML/outerHTML run string as HTML code, textContent
run string as string. When set 4 of them, all tag inside current tag will delete. 
Just "value" attribute is still remain. (But it just for <input> ?)
---> innerHTML & outerHTML : are so powerful, so dangerous. The input (we pass to them) will be used as HTML code, so we can run script through them (HTML5 prevented this)

---> outerHTML: Have a problem with outerHTML, not understande yet !!!

- insertAdjacentHTML vs insertAdjacentElement
      (1)                     (2)
---> (1): insert a new HTML code to DOM. (2) insert (change position) an element that existed in DOM

- parentNode.removeChild(el)

- A.contains(B): is B in A ?
